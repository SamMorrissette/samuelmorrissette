<p>I am currently taking a graduate class in Multivariate Statistics in the second semester of my masters program. As a final project, we had the opportuntity to research an article and create a small presentation to summarize the article and discuss its merit.</p>
<p>I chose an article released in 2006 by Price, et al. that had a major impact in the field of genetics. In the article (which can be found online), the authors propose an algorithm that utilizes principal components analysis, a dimension-reduction method often used in the field of statistics. If you’re interested, you can find my slides here:</p>
